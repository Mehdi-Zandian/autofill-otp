# Autofill OTP

- It's better to use JSX instead of TSX for the component.
- autoComplete="one-time-code" is a must attribute on the input tag.
- Test on production and on a real domain (use Vercel for testing)
- The domain in the SMS format must be exactly your website domain.
- OTP digits in the SMS should be exactly what the website expects.
